Sometimes you want to select multiple vertices at once. In order to do so, you must be in edit mode. Then hold control while dragging over the shape. 

The problem with this method is that it only selects the vertices that are visible. In our case we want to select all vertices, so we press Z in order to view the wireframe. Then we do the same thing as before, but this time it will select all of the vertices. 

Now that they are all selected we can use the normal tools like move or rotate.
